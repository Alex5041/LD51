This game changes every 10 seconds.

# Controls:
## Main
WASD to move,

Left mouse button to shoot,

Right mouse button to pick words. 

M to mute music, N to mute sounds.

## Word manipulation
Spacebar to swap non-sign words (empty cells swap too!).

Right click to delete word.

# Word rules:
There are 3 ways to create a statement:
1. Two same symbols: *tree, tree => more trees*
2. Sign (+, -) and object: *minus, ruler => make smaller*
3. Sign and two object, one of which is modifier (heart, boot and ruler are modifiers): *plus, bullet, heart => bullet will pierce targets*

**From level3, each 10 seconds target changes, from player to enemy. Non neutral statement will affect current target, (more trees is a neutral statement, but more bullets is not)**

Notes: 
1. if you don't get hit, something might happen
2. Movable trees are not a thing :(
